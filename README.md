# nanopath

![nanopath logo](imgs/nanopath_logo.png)

`nanopath` is a super lean experimental harness for training tile-level computational pathology foundation models, inspired by [nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat). It trains on at most 1,000,000 TCGA tile presentations on a single GPU and covers the full pretraining pipeline using tiles produced from the public TCGA dataset (12k WSIs) and built-in downstream probes spanning classification, segmentation, slide-level mutation/progression, survival, and robustness. The goal is to easily explore and iterate on research directions to see what works best on small-scale, then we scale up the best performing training recipes with larger compute.

This repository is intentionally made to be compatible with [autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch)-style pursuits, and we even have a live autoresearch-style plot in [Leaderboard](#leaderboard). Nanopath models train until the next full batch would exceed the 1,000,000 tile-presentation sample cap or the run reaches the 1e18-FLOP cap, then run the fixed downstream benchmark suite.

## Quickstart

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) first if you don't have it, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MedARC-AI/nanopath.git && cd nanopath
uv sync && source .venv/bin/activate
wandb login  # optional; set WANDB_MODE=offline to keep W&B local

# download pretraining & probe datasets & DINOv2 pretrained ckpt
python prepare.py configs/smoke.yaml download=True

# smoke test: short training plus the fixed full probe suite
sbatch submit/train_1gpu.sbatch configs/smoke.yaml
# or directly on a GPU machine: python train.py configs/smoke.yaml

# train and evaluate the current main nanopath recipe
RUN_DIR=/data/$USER/nanopath/main/my-run
sbatch submit/train_1gpu.sbatch configs/main.yaml output_dir=$RUN_DIR
# or directly on a GPU machine: python train.py configs/main.yaml output_dir=$RUN_DIR

# publish a completed full run to the live labless plot
./labless/submit_to_labless.py output_dir=$RUN_DIR run_name=kde-crops notes="what changed"
```

`pyproject.toml` pins `torch` / `torchvision` against the CUDA 12.9 wheel index. If your GPU/driver needs a different CUDA build, edit the `torch` and `torchvision` lines in `pyproject.toml` before `uv sync`.

A successful model training prints periodic train lines, appends metrics to `metrics.jsonl`, and writes the final comparison artifact to `summary.json`. `configs/smoke.yaml` is simply meant to pretrain briefly and run the fixed downstream probe suite to ensure everything works.

Score is final `mean_probe_score` across our 11-dataset benchmarking suite, assessing tile-level classification (linear probing, knn, few-shot), segmentation, slide-level classification (progression, mutation, survival), and robustness. These benchmarks are derived from [THUNDER](https://mics-lab.github.io/thunder/) and [PathoBench](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/patho-bench), with modifications to keep single-GPU evaluation lightweight. We operate only on train/validation splits for most datasets; the survival probe uses PathoBench's official five-fold CPTAC-PDA OS evaluation because that task is defined as cross-validation. See [benchmarking/README.md](benchmarking/README.md) for more information.

Baseline rows are frozen reference checkpoints evaluated with the same probe suite. They help calibrate the plot, but pathology-specific baselines are not valid initialization points for nanopath leaderboard submissions. The reference scripts live in `baselines/`; run Virchow and GigaPath separately with `baselines/virchow_baseline.py` and `baselines/gigapath_baseline.py`. Historical Labless rows remain useful provenance, but locked benchmark comparisons should use fresh runs after any benchmark-definition change.

### How to submit to the leaderboard

`configs/main.yaml` is the current `nanopath` main-branch training recipe. Submit completed full runs to labless:

```bash
RUN_DIR=/data/$USER/nanopath/main/my-run
./labless/submit_to_labless.py output_dir=$RUN_DIR run_name=kde-crops notes="what changed and why"
```

The `run_name` is the short label shown next to your dot on the Labless plot; keep it under 20 characters and make it describe what changed. A copied config such as `configs/new_config.yaml` is fine if the completed `summary.json` still reports `max_train_samples: 1000000`, `tile_presentations <= 1000000`, and `max_train_flops: 1e18`. Short smoke-sized runs and failed runs are not public Labless submissions.

To top the leaderboard you must beat the highest validated Labless run on `mean_probe_score` by at least 0.01. Submit the run to labless; that public submission is the leaderboard claim, with the saved source snapshot, changed files, notes, metrics, hardware, and optional W&B link attached. Public submissions have no wall-clock limit, so train on whatever hardware you have access to. [@PaulScotti](https://github.com/PaulScotti) will inspect promising submissions, rerun the candidate on the maintainer's single 80 GB H100 with a different rng seed, and validate it on Labless if training completes within 2 hours and the rerun still improves by at least 0.01. If its code is pushed to nanopath `main`, Labless marks that run separately as `main`. **You don't need an H100 or a PR to submit**; labless handles the public record and maintainer validation.

Code-cleanup PRs are still welcome when they simplify the codebase without changing benchmark peformance on the main recipe. Leaderboard claims should go through labless instead of a pull request.

### What you must NOT change for a leaderboard submission

Anything not explicitly fixed below (e.g., model architecture, training objective, optimizer, lr scheduler, data augmentations, masking, dataset curation) is fair game for modification.

**Training ends at 1,000,000 tile-presentation samples OR 1e18 total FLOPs**

Every leaderboard run is bounded by two possible caps:

- **`train.max_train_samples` ≤ 1,000,000 tile presentations**. A training sample is one source TCGA tile emitted as one dataloader item; if the same underlying tile is seen again later, that is another tile presentation. Teacher/student views, global/local crops, masks, or other augmentations derived from that tile do not multiply the sample count, though their compute still counts toward FLOPs. `train.py` never starts a batch that would push `summary.tile_presentations` over the cap.
- **`train.max_train_flops` ≤ 1e18 training FLOPs**, measured directly via `torch.utils.flop_counter.FlopCounterMode` on the first step (forward + backward + optimizer.step) and reused thereafter since per-step shapes are fixed. This counts everything that touches the GPU during a step (student backbone, EMA teacher forward, projection heads, masking, etc.).

Wall time is logged for diagnostics and standardized reruns, but it is not a public-submission eligibility cap. Maintainer validation is separate: the submitted recipe must complete training on the maintainer's single 80 GB H100 within 2 hours.
Intensive preprocessing before model training starts, such as tile extraction, data curation, metadata joins, indexing, or embedding generation, is allowed and is not counted as training time.

**TCGA as the only tile source**
- Every image tile used for training must be produced exclusively from the 12K TCGA WSIs. You can change tile extraction, filtering, sampling, curation, and preprocessing before the capped model-training run begins.
- Public non-tile information is fair game: metadata, clinical/genomic labels, text, ontologies, annotations, or other non-image-tile signals from any public source may be used however you want.

**Probe evaluation must be untouched**
- All of `probe.py` and `benchmarking/`
- All probe config variables in `configs/main.yaml`.

**Pretrained models are OK only if not pathology-specific**
You can use any pretrained model however you want, including for initialization, teachers, data curation, or preprocessing, as long as it was not originally trained on pathology-related data. DINOv2 is allowed; H-optimus-0, OpenMidnight, and other pathology-trained checkpoints are not.

### Labless for live tracking

Submit completed full runs to the live tracker:

```bash
RUN_DIR=/data/$USER/nanopath/main/my-run
./labless/submit_to_labless.py output_dir=$RUN_DIR run_name=kde-crops notes="what changed and why"
```

The script reads `summary.json` and `metrics.jsonl`, uses the run's saved source snapshot (`output_dir/labless_source`), writes `labless_submission.json`, verifies full runs from `max_train_samples: 1000000`, `tile_presentations <= 1000000`, and `max_train_flops: 1e18`, signs you in through GitHub's no-scope device flow, and posts to `api.labless.dev`. Labless records the verified GitHub login and accepts at most 10 submissions per login per 24 hours. W&B can be online or offline; online runs add a public W&B link, while source review always comes from the local snapshot. Smoke checks and failed runs stay local. The labless website, run log, and plot update automatically; new completed full runs stay `pending` until maintainer validation. See [labless/README.md](labless/README.md) for details.

## Repository layout

### Primary files meant to be hacked
- `train.py` — main pretraining loop
- `model.py` — model architecture and training objectives
- `dataloader.py` — TCGA tile loader and data augmentations
- `configs/{smoke,main}.yaml` — training recipes (e.g., hyperparameters)

### Helper files
- `AGENTS.md` — guidelines for design philosophy, coding rules, experiment discipline, cluster conventions, etc. Note this is Paul's personal `AGENTS.md` file and has instructions specific to our MedARC cluster—you should modify this file to suit your own setup!
- `benchmarking/` — supports probing/downstream evaluation.
- `prepare.py` — data prep: verify or download pretraining data + probe datasets + any pretrained weights.
- `probe.py` — downstream probes (KNN, few-shot, linear, segmentation, slide AUROC, survival, robustness).
- `submit/train_1gpu.sbatch` — SLURM launcher for single-GPU training.
- `labless/submit_to_labless.py` — package a run and post it to the live labless tracker.
- `download_TCGA.sh` — manual utility, run by hand if you want the full 12K TCGA open-access SVS slide set (~13 TB) for forking the tile-extraction recipe. Not invoked by `prepare.py` and not needed for any standard training workflow.
- `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` — Python dependencies used by `uv sync`.

## Data

`prepare.py` prepares the necessary data for pretraining and downstream probing. Flag `download=True` to fetch/prepare the configured datasets into the folders specified by the YAML; flag `download=False` to verify that all required paths are already populated.

On the MedARC cluster, the checked-in `/data` and `/block` paths are the intended defaults. On a fresh clone with no such mounts, `prepare.py … download=True` rewrites those roots in place in the config you pass (data, probes, `output_dir`, `wandb_dir`) to point into `nanopath/data/<name>`, preserving all comments — so it just works with no manual YAML edits, and `train.py`/`probe.py` then read the corrected config unchanged. Only roots that are missing and whose `/data` or `/block` mount is absent or not writable get rewritten; the rewrite is idempotent and a no-op on the cluster. To point elsewhere, edit `data.dataset_dir` and the `probe.dataset_roots.*` paths to writable storage before downloading.

**What `download=True` does**
1. **TCGA tiles**: `huggingface_hub.snapshot_download` (filtered to `shard-*.parquet`) pulls the 200 parquet shards (~120 GB total, `{path: string, jpeg: binary}` rows with 64-row row groups) from [`medarc/nanopath`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/medarc/nanopath) into `data.dataset_dir`.
2. **Probe datasets**: for each empty configured root, fetches/unpacks and, where needed, pre-extracts the probe data. BRACS, BreaKHis, PCam, PanNuke, UCLA Lung, MHIST, CoNSeP, and SurGen use the [`medarc/nanopath`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/medarc/nanopath) probe mirror for portable noninteractive setup; CPTAC-PDA OS downloads the official TCIA PathDB SVS files and builds its cache locally; PathoROB and MoNuSAC come from their official public sources. Before fetching MHIST or CoNSeP, `prepare.py` prints that users must satisfy the official upstream form/access terms first. Slide-level probes cache 20x/512 tissue grids (`tiles.parquet`, `surgen-*.parquet`, or `patches.parquet`) so `probe.py` never opens raw WSIs during training/probing; SurGen streams deterministic raster-spaced sub-bags for runtime, while CPTAC-PDA OS embeds its full cached grid.
3. **DINOv2 backbone weights**: `torch.hub.load_state_dict_from_url` fetches the Meta checkpoint for `model.type` from `dl.fbaipublicfiles.com` into `~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/`.

**Prerequisites**
- ~120 GB free wherever `data.dataset_dir` lives for the parquet shards (cluster default: `/data/nanopath_parquet`).
- Probe data disk varies by suite. Expect that it might take a few hours for one-time downloading and preprocessing of all probe datasets.

### Regenerating the tile dataset from raw SVS

`prepare.py` itself never touches raw SVS files—it always pulls the ready-made parquet shards from HF. If you want, however, you can download the full ~13 TB original SVS files from TCGA and pre-extract different tiles to pretrain on. Two-step workflow (decode SVS → JPEG dir + manifest, then pack into parquet shards):

```bash
# 1) Download the full 12K open-access TCGA SVS slide set (~13 TB).
bash download_TCGA.sh /data/TCGA 8

# 2) Decode + pack. prepare_tiles deterministically subsamples the sample list
#    to TARGET_TILE_COUNT (4M, hardcoded in prepare.py — bump it for a bigger
#    dataset) and writes JPEGs + manifest.txt under jpeg_dir; reruns are
#    resumable (existing JPEGs are EOF-validated and reused). pack_from_jpeg_dir
#    then walks the manifest, splits into NUM_SHARDS=200 chunks, and writes
#    shard-NNNNN.parquet files with 64-row row groups (the layout the
#    dataloader expects). Once it's done you can rm -rf the jpeg_dir.
python -c "
from pathlib import Path
from prepare import prepare_tiles, pack_from_jpeg_dir
jpeg_dir = Path('/data/nanopath_jpegs_tmp')
prepare_tiles(Path('/data/TCGA/sample_dataset_30.txt'), jpeg_dir, split_seed=42)
pack_from_jpeg_dir(jpeg_dir, jpeg_dir / 'manifest.txt', Path('/data/nanopath_parquet'))
"
```

To publish a new variant of the dataset, you can push the resulting shards to a fresh HF dataset repo and update `HF_REPO_ID` in `prepare.py`.

## Running

Smoke (short training + full probe):

```bash
sbatch submit/train_1gpu.sbatch configs/smoke.yaml
# or directly on a GPU machine: `python train.py configs/smoke.yaml`
```

Full main `nanopath` recipe:

```bash
sbatch submit/train_1gpu.sbatch configs/main.yaml
# or directly on a GPU machine: `python train.py configs/main.yaml`
```

`configs/main.yaml` is sized for an 80 GB H100 at `train.batch_size: 128`. On smaller cards you can set `train.activation_checkpointing: true` if you OOM. Smoke fits comfortably on any 24 GB+ GPU.

## Outputs

The `/data`- and `/block`-rooted defaults below are the MedARC cluster layout; on a fresh clone with neither mount, `prepare.py … download=True` rewrites these roots (data, probes, `output_dir`, `wandb_dir`) in the config to live under `nanopath/data/` instead.

- run outputs: `project.output_dir` (default is `/data/$USER/nanopath/main/...`). Final probe results log to `metrics.jsonl`.
- wandb: `/data/$USER/nanopath/wandb`.
- parquet tile shards: `data.dataset_dir` (defaults to `/data/nanopath_parquet`).
- probe datasets: `probe.dataset_roots` (defaults to shared `/block/...` and `/data/...` paths on the MedARC cluster).
- DINOv2 backbone weights: `~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/` for the selected `model.type`.
- SLURM logs: `slurm/<jobid>.{out,err}` in the repo.
- labless source snapshot: `project.output_dir/labless_source`.
- labless submission payload: `project.output_dir/labless_submission.json`.
- checkpoints: rolling `latest.pt` written every `train.save_every` steps under `project.output_dir`, plus one final save at end of run. `save_every: null` (smoke) disables both; probes always get their own short-lived checkpoint regardless.
