# nanopath-evals

This directory describes and audits nanopath's fixed downstream benchmark, termed `nanopath-evals`, that completes a diverse suite of tile-level and slide-level evaluations in approximately 20 minutes on a single H100 GPU. This benchmark is a fast development-data proxy for performance on official THUNDER, HEST, and CPTAC evaluations; note that no test samples from these official benchmarks are touched by `nanopath-evals`.

The executable definition is [`probe.py`](../probe.py) plus the five checked-in JSON manifests in this directory. The prose here explains that definition; if the code, manifests, and documentation ever disagree, the release is not valid as a nanopath model. Labless locks `probe.py`, this entire directory, and the probe configuration for comparable public runs.

## Score definition

All components enter the scalar on 0–1 scales:

```text
classification = mean over 12 datasets of
                 mean(linear-grid mean F1, KNN-grid mean F1, SimpleShot F1)

segmentation    = mean(PanNuke F1, SegPath epithelial F1,
                       SegPath lymphocyte F1)
progression     = UCLA Lung macro-OVR AUC
mutation        = SurGen RAS macro-OVR AUC
survival        = mean(LEOPARD BCR c-index, CPTAC-PDA OS c-index)

cohort_croma  = median over tiles of (mean OS distance - mean SO distance)
                / (mean OS distance + mean SO distance)
robustness    = mean over PathoROB cohorts of (1 + cohort_croma) / 2

final_score = 0.30 * classification + 0.15 * segmentation
            + 0.175 * progression + 0.15 * mutation
            + 0.075 * survival + 0.15 * robustness
```

Classification, segmentation, progression, mutation, survival, and robustness contribute 30%, 15%, 17.5%, 15%, 7.5%, and 15%, respectively.

## Fixed suite

| Family | Datasets | Scored metric | Protocol details |
|---|---|---|---|
| Classification | BACH, BRACS, BreaKHis, CRC, ESCA, MHIST, PCam, SPIDER breast/colorectal/skin/thorax, WILDS | macro-F1 | [classification.md](classification.md) |
| Segmentation | PanNuke, SegPath epithelial, SegPath lymphocytes | THUNDER weighted per-image macro-F1 | [segmentation.md](segmentation.md) |
| Progression | UCLA Lung | macro-OVR AUC | [slide_probes.md](slide_probes.md) |
| Mutation | SurGen RAS | macro-OVR AUC | [slide_probes.md](slide_probes.md) |
| Survival | LEOPARD BCR, CPTAC-PDA OS | Harrell c-index | [slide_probes.md](slide_probes.md) |
| Robustness | PathoROB Camelyon, Tolkach ESCA | CRoMa | [pathorob.md](pathorob.md) |

The complete fixed suite is mandatory. `prepare_probe_state()` rejects partial, reordered, added, or substituted task lists.

## Data boundary

[The THUNDER manifest](thunder_v2.json) is the only classification and segmentation manifest used at runtime. Every dataset entry has exactly `root`, `train`, and `val`; there is no `test` key.

The downloadable evaluation snapshot is [`medarc/nanopath-evals`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/medarc/nanopath-evals) pinned in `prepare.py` to revision `5c8f7848298fa55e09e0bcc58a90a8e9b1c8d426`. It is about 192 GiB and contains only the selected development assets. If you are on our MedARC cluster, you do not need to download this snapshot because contents are already under `/data`.

We try to reduce overlap between our pretraining dataset (TCGA) and downstream data distributions:

- CCRCC, TCGA CRC-MSI, TCGA-TILs, TCGA-Uniform, and OCELOT are excluded because their evaluation images are explicitly TCGA.
- We still include ESCA because while its training samples contain some TCGA images, its validation subset is UKK-only.
- We still include PanNuke because it mixes TCGA and local hospital slides without specifying which slides belong to which source (this limitation is documented in [segmentation.md](segmentation.md)).

## Frozen-backbone contract

`nanopath-evals` operates on frozen representations. Classification and slide probes consume `model.probe_features()`, allowing a recipe to define test-time feature aggregation. Segmentation consumes all non-register patch channels from `model.encode_image()`. If a model emits an expanded spatial grid, it is area-pooled back to its native patch grid before the shared decoder; feature channels are not discarded. CRoMa intentionally bypasses `probe_features()` and uses PathoROB's fixed CLS-plus-mean-patch adapter so model-specific aggregation cannot alter the robustness protocol.

Encoder inference uses fp16 autocast and caches classification/slide embeddings as float32. Segmentation patch vectors are cached as per-vector signed int8 plus fp16 scales. See [validation.md](validation.md) for release timing and validation evidence.
